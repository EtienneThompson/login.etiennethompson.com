## Purpose:

This application is designed to be a simple OAuth login application for use across an ecosystem of web applications being developed. It allows users to access the different applications which they have been given access to.

Access is defined by users having:
1. A username and password to use in the login application.
2. Providing the login service a valid application id to log into.
3. Being defined as a user of that application.

These access rules allow finer control over who can access what applications within the ecosystem, rather than just blindly granting all users access to all applications.

# Getting started with the application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
